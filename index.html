            <h1> “Eletelephony” </h1> 
            <h4>by Laura E. Richards</h4>
            <p style=" font-size: large; line-height: 1.5em; font-family:'Times New Roman', Times, serif"> Once there was an elephant,
                Who tried to use the telephant—
                No! No! I mean an elephone
                Who tried to use the telephone—
                (Dear me! I am not certain quite
                That even now I’ve got it right.)
                Howe’er it was, he got his trunk
                Entangled in the telephunk;
                The more he tried to get it free,
                The louder buzzed the telephee—
                (I fear I’d better drop the song
                Of elephop and telephong!)

            <h1> “The Silliest Teacher in School” </h1> 
            <h4>By Darren Sardelli</h4> 
            <p style=" font-size: large; line-height: 1.5em; font-family:'Times New Roman', Times, serif">Our teacher gave detention
                to the fountains in the hall.
                She handed extra homework
                to the artwork on the wall.
                 
                We saw her point a finger
                at a banner and a sign.
                She said their bad behavior
                was completely out of line.
                 
                The principal approached her
                and said, “What is all this fuss?
                I heard you tried to punish
                all the tires on a bus.
                 
                “You’ve made the teachers angry
                by disrupting all their classes,
                so if you want to keep this job,
                you have to wear your glasses!”

        <h1> “Herbert Hillbert Hubert Snod” </h1> 
        <h4>by Denise Rodgers</h4> 
        <p style=" font-size: large; line-height: 1.5em; font-family:'Times New Roman', Times, serif">Herbert Hillbert Hubert Snod
            was known for eating all things odd.
            The thing that bothered me the most
            was he spread toothpaste on his toast.
            “It’s springtime fresh, so cool and minty.”
            His smiling eyes were bright and squinty.
            On baked potatoes, he would slather
            one half can of shave cream lather.
            Who knows how his tum could cope
            as he ingested cubes of soap.
            At times his food choice made a scene;
            at least he kept his innards clean.
